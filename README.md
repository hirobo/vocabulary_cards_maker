# vocabulary_cards_maker
Create a csv file from an article of “Top-Thema mit Vokabeln (Deutsche Welle ).” : PHP

Currently I’m learning German, but it is not so easy as you know ;)

* How can I build up my vocabulary?  —> Read [Deutsche Welle](http://www.dw.de/)!!
* How can I memorize the vocabulary? —> Use  flash card service e.g. [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/)

[Deutsche Welle](http://www.dw.de/) is a German news service that offers significant German language learning resources and I often check the articles of **Top-Thema mit Vokabeln**.

While, [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) is a great flash card service that helps to remember things easily.
So, I created this web app!


## How to Use it?
Please have a look this demo page:

http://secure-lowlands-9935.herokuapp.com/

First, you can find RSS feed of articles. Of course you may click the link to read it.
But this time, please drag a link to the right gray area.
Then the page will be changed and here you can find a button **Download Vocabulary List** and click it. 
Choose a directory where you save it.
